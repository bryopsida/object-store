This is a simple service that stores objects on the local filesystem. Must be used on combination with [Object-Store-Router](https://github.com/bryopsida/object-store-router) for sharding across multiple machines, and [Object-Store-Sync](https://github.com/bryopsida/object-store-sync) to automatically push files as modified on a file system to the store.
