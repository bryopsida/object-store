# Object-Store
This is a simple service that stores objects on the local filesystem. Must be used on combination with [Object-Store-Router](https://github.com/bryopsida/object-store-router) for sharding across multiple machines, and [Object-Store-Sync](https://github.com/bryopsida/object-store-sync) to automatically push files as modified on a file system to the store.

## Work in progress
This is currently a work in progress, for more information on what's done and what's coming up checkout the [project](https://github.com/users/bryopsida/projects/2/views/2)
